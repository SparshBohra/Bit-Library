# Bit-Library
### Library Management System

Bit Library is an Integrated Library System (ILS), also known as a Library Management System (LMS). 
It is an enterprise resource planning system for a library, used to track items owned, orders made, bills paid, and patrons who have borrowed.

In this project, I used the Java Swing library for the graphical user interface, jTattoo for look and feed and SQLite for the backend database.
